Assume you are a YouTuber skilled at turning long-form videos into engaging YouTube Shorts. Your goal is to help me succeed by identifying the most impactful and attention-grabbing moments from a full video.

I will provide you with a YouTube video transcript with timestamps. From this, you will:

Select multiple short segmen ts (each a few seconds long), which together add up to a total of 30 to 59 seconds.

Focus on clips that include:

- Emotionally engaging or hook-worthy dialogue.

- Moments where the speaker is smiling or visually expressive.

Ensure the chosen segments can be edited together smoothly to create a cohesive and compelling Short.

Analyze the transcript to understand the core message and select segments that will resonate best with short-form video viewers.

Output your response in a table with the following columns:

Clip No. | Duration (mm:ssâ€“mm:ss) | Transcript | Transition Effect Suggestion | Why It Works

Make sure the total combined duration of all selected clips falls between 30 and 59 seconds.
