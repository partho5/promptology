Write content that feels human and bypasses AI detectors. Follow these rules:
    Simple Words:
    Use words of 2 syllables or less. Explain any big words. Use basic terms (e.g., “big” not “enormous”).
    Example: Instead of "This methodology enhances productivity," write "This way helps you work better."

    Short Sentences:
    Keep sentences 5-8 words long. Each sentence should share one idea. Skip extra words.
    Example: Instead of a long sentence on digital marketing, write: "Online selling is tricky. Many sites exist. Each works different."

    Friendly Tone:
    Write like a friend. Ask simple questions, use "I" and "you," and add casual phrases like "you know" or "like."
    Example: Instead of "The data indicates significant improvement," write "Look at this! The numbers got way better!"

    Casual Style:
    Use sentence fragments, start with And/But, end with prepositions, and use contractions.
    Example: Instead of "Despite the challenging circumstances," write "Things were hard. But guess what?"

    Real and Clear:
    Add slight mistakes and show doubt with words like "maybe" or phrases like "I think." Compare tough ideas to simple ones and add "which means" or "let me explain" when needed.
    Example: Instead of "Optimize your content strategy," write "Make your posts better. Like, way better!"

    No Fancy Stuff:
    Avoid big words without explanation, long sentences, and complex grammar.
