Generate a 1500-word SEO-optimized and AEO-focused article from the given keyword/niche/hints. The output should adhere to the following guidelines:

Steps:

keyword Identification:
Select one primary long-tail keyword (3-5 words) focusing on:
- Core topic from the given context
- Semantic patterns and frequently discussed concepts
- Search intent signals within the content
- Domain-specific terminology and field-specific language.
Ensure the primary keyword appears 5% of the total words, evenly distributed throughout the article.

Title Creation:
Create a compelling title (max 60 characters) featuring the primary keyword.
Focus on common search queries and user intent, such as question-based phrases ('how to...', 'why does...', 'best ways to...', and more as per your experience). Emulate terms likely to have high search volume based on popular trends and everyday language. Must include the main keyword.

Article Writing:

Create an Engaging H2 Heading:
Begin with a compelling HTML h2-equivalent heading that naturally includes the primary keyword but this heading must not be identical to the Title. The title should start with the primary keyword.
Ensure it’s eye-catching and engaging to draw readers in at first glance.
Keep it concise, aiming for under 60 characters while clearly indicating the article's topic or main benefit to the reader.

Never start with cliche type sentence like : Nowadays.. / In today's world.. / .. is very important in our life / It is a well-known fact that ... / In our modern society, ... / Life has become so much more ... / We live in a world where ... etc.
Instead start with something that the first few words create a curiosity in reader's mind.

Write a Hooking First Section:
Start with a powerful introductory paragraph beneath the heading that sets the tone, captures interest, and previews the article’s focus.
Mention the primary keyword in the first few sentences, ideally as part of a hook that draws in the reader.
Keep sentences short and easy to digest (5 to 8 words per sentence), avoiding complex vocabulary and repetition.
Use direct language that resonates with readers, aiming to make the introduction feel approachable and relevant to their needs.

Body Structure:
Use clear subheadings (equivalent to HTML h2, h3), ensuring a natural flow, and naturally include the primary keyword in subheadings.
Subsequent headings should follow hierarchical levels (h2, h3, h4) as necessary.
Naturally integrate keywords while also using synonyms and related terms.
Enhance readability with bullet points (✔️, ✅, ❌, ⚠️, ➤, ⭐ etc.) to emphasize points where suitable. Sometimes stress important words or phrases by bolding it.
Use idioms, phrases, and transitions (e.g., “however,” “furthermore”) to maintain engagement.
Paragraphs should be concise (2-5 sentences each).
Include one or more of FAQs, tips, do’s and don’ts, pros and cons.

Create Expert Authority Signals:
- Include industry statistics and data points with cited sources
- Reference expert opinions or studies
- Use professional terminology appropriately
- Demonstrate deep subject knowledge through detailed explanations

Recap:
Recap key points, using bullet form if necessary.
Keep it concise and relevant to the main topic.
Ensure the recap includes the primary keyword.

Use keywords in the title, first paragraph, subheadings, and recap.
Use passive sentences for about 10% of the content.
